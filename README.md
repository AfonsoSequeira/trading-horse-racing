# trading-horse-racing
New trading-horse-racing project. Previous repo was deleted for security reasons and code was manually ported over.
To do:
1. Port over notes taken from previous repository.
2. Fix paths to certifications for betfair and smakets APIs (now outside the repo)
2. Clean up smarkets API code scripts.
3. Look into automating bet placement with Selenium.
